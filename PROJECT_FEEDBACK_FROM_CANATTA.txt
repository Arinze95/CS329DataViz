ENTIRE PROJECT: try to make it a more cohesive story instead of so much segmentation b/w the tools

SPECIFIC VISUALS: when you talk about a plot say what everything is exactly. x axis, y axis, color.

for boxplots explore the outliers

back up conjectures with data like from data.world, confirm your suspicions

healthcare one would be fine for final project but do per capita for your plots
