SUPER IMPORTANT:
~~Dont forget to read the project feedback from canatta, a  text document in the main repo (As opposed to this text doc which is in final project folder)~~
tl;dr: use project 3 interactive documeent as a guide when you do your writing, spell check by copy pasting to word, make sure the plots look good including the labels,
