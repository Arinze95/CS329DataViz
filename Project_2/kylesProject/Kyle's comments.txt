Kyle's tableau thing:
These dual-axis visuals show the comparison of the average total payment vs the average medicare payment to Texas hospitals in 2017. The data is grouped by hospital region and the 
user can filter by diagnosis.

In all cases, the total payment will be at or above the total Medicare payment because up to 100% of bills can be covered by Medicare. Only the top 10 regions are listed,
determined by total revenue across all hospitals.

The top and bottom can be independently filtered for any given set of diagnoses. The default rendering shows the top visual including all diagnoses, and the
bottom visual can include only one diagnosis like Septicimia or severe Sepsis.
For this rendering, it can be seen that hospitals in the houston region have a disproportionately high amount of medical bills charged for vascular problems
compared to the average of all regions. This is possibly due to the quality of care in Houston hospitals, implying some of the best vascular surgeons in Texas
practice medicine in the Houston region.

Kyle's Boxplot:
This boxplot shows the distribution of the Average total Payments for the ten highest paying regions. Each color corresponds to a different diagnosis.
This allows the user to make comparisons across both city and disease. For example, when we plot vascular problems, heart failures and renal failures across the regions we see that 
vascular problems incur the highest payments in the Houston and Dallas region, implying a higher quality of vascular health care in these regions

diagnosis metrics such as the average price and average price covered by medicare.
