use plotly unless you have a good reason not to use plotly

shiny cheat shet is helpful

if you look at top hat hhistograms code on tophat u can see cannatas code has soure("histogramUI") to get R code from the same folder
and when you click publish it should list all of them

tophathistograms.tar.gz has all the files

every plot will have 2 fils



see comments on lines 120-122 of topHatBoxplots in project 2 folder
(basically 2 new files are created by making new files with different names and then doing a replace all for the ne variable name......
but if u want it to be a different plot with dfferent sql query then you go to the server code ..........but in cannatas example all three
plots use the query from df1.......so to make new query just take the df made from query in tophatboxplots, copy paste it, call it df4 for example
if u have the 4th plot....
and change x=shpping cost to sales if that is what you want your query in

change the query then the actual plot




copy and paste dashboard code is part of it

cannata put r code that ffeeds into the document in a seperate file

in tableau for insights: he wants an average line and also in tableau he wants dual axis plot

Do dual axis and histograms for insights

2-20

he has furtehr broken up the code, now he has broken it up so now he has a different data file for each query (on the tar file on ch 3 of tophat)
and each . every plot has its own UI and plot file, and everything is put together in the RMD file. and you put all these on github.
PART OF THE GRADE IS MAKING SURE YOU GOT ALL YOUR FILES ON GITHUB

see the comments on for

2-22-18 notes

every plot has 2 fils: server file and UI file

dataA and dataB are two different queries



ADDING NEW STUFF: 

step 1 adding new sidebar item to dashboard
see your coments in the code from 2-22

the instructions on cannatas interactive
document (actually
just to go tophat and click on link)
also tell us what to do

sometimes if you solved an error restart Rstduio


...now moving on to step 5 and 6

open up one of the similar files and
do find and replace __3 with __5
since this is the first plot
(for the example if u you open bothUI)
then do save AS to make a new file
based on what you made in previous shade

instructions are on tophat if you c
