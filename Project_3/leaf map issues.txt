Leaflet map/tiles bug appears to be a problem with MapQuest
I am running the same version of the leaflet package as Dr. Cannata, but I was still having issues getting the tiles to appear on the leaflet map (it seemed like the rest of the class was having this issue as well). 

 

I couldn't figure out what was causing the issue, but when I switched from using MapQuest to Stamen Maps, the tiles appeared. Under the map server file, I changed addProviderTiles("MapQuestOpen.Aerial") to addProviderTiles("Stamen.TonerLite"), and the bug seemed to be resolved.
